# Python Review: Functions Classwork

### Problem 1:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help (with variations :-P )
* Create a function that has a loop
* Prompt for numbers until the user enters ```q``` to quit
* If the user doesn't enter ```q```, ask them to input another number
* When the user enters ```q``` to quit, print the SUM of all numbers entered

BONUS: 
* Write your code so that it it doesn't matter if the User enters a lowercase or an uppercase ```q``` to quit
* Add extra validation to check that if the User doesn't enter ```q``` what they did enter is actually a number

### Problem 2:
* Create a function ```problem2()```
* In this function prompt the user for 2 numbers
* Create a second function called ```do_the_math``` that accepts 2 parameters (the 2 entered numbers)
* In the ```do_the_math``` calculate the SUM, DIFFERENCE, PRODUCT, and QUOTIENT (division result) and return them as a dictionary to the calling function

  Example: Dictionary result returned if the argumants ```25``` and ```10``` are passed to the function:

  ```{'diff': 15, 'prod': 250, 'quot': 2.5, 'sum': 35}```

* In your ```problem2()``` function, print the dictionary result returned from your ```do_the_math``` function using string literal formatting

  Example: Execution and Output 

  ```
  Enter the First Number in the calculation:
  25
  Enter the Second Number in the calculation:
  10
  Here are your results for the numbers 25 and 10:
  The SUM result is 35
  The DIFFERENCE result is 15
  The PRODUCT result is 250
  The DIVISION result is 2.5

  ```
